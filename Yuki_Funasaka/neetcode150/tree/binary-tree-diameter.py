Diameter of Binary Tree
Easy

The diameter of a binary tree is defined as the length of the longest path between any two nodes within the tree.
The path does not necessarily have to pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes in a binary tree is the number of edges between the nodes.
Note that the path can not include the same node twice.

Given the root of a binary tree root, return the diameter of the tree.

Constraints:

1 <= number of nodes in the tree <= 100
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

        Return the diameter of the tree.
        This means return the longest number of edges between two nodes.

        I'm not sure absolutely.
        If say so, we would better to think about an edge case.
        If the tree has only one node that is just a root node, the diameter is zero.
        If the tree has only two nodes that are a root node and a child node, we return one.
        If the tree has only three nodes, there are few patterns.
            1) one is parent, two are children.
            2) one is parent, one is child. And that child node has a child.
        Either cases return two as a diameter of it.

        Anyway, the diameter related to the depth of the tree, maybe.
        So I guess we might use DFS algorithm.
